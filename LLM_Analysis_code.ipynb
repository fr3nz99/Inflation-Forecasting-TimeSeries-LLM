Based on the tweets you provided, it seems that inflation in the UK in January 2018 was a topic of concern for many people. Here are some key points that can be gleaned from the tweets:\n\n1. Inflation was expected to be high in January 2018, with some tweets mentioning figures around 3% (TWEET=uk inflation dips to 3% to ease pressure on boe for rate rise).\n2. There was a lot of discussion about the impact of inflation on various industries, such as the housing market (TWEET=hundreds of hospitals in the #us are forming their own #pharmaceutical company to combat high drug prices) and the retail sector (TWEET=retail money that went in during the holidays must be cringing).\n3. Some tweets mentioned the potential for inflation to affect the value of the pound (TWEET=uk \\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xac\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xa7 inflation down to 3%, gbp \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xb7 at its highest level against usd since the referendum!. good to know remain voters can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t complain about these anymore..).\n4. There were also some tweets that mentioned the impact of inflation on specific products, such as food (TWEET=no surprise that your food sales slumped over the festive period.. you\\'ve put your prices up by at least 10% for each product..) and oil (TWEET=brent touches $70!. this impacts central bank policy reaction functions.. sure oil effects are transitory... but what\\xe2\\x80\\xa6).\n\nBased on these tweets, it seems that inflation was a significant concern in the UK in January 2018, with many people discussing the potential impact on various industries and products. However, it's important to note that these tweets are not necessarily representative of the entire UK population, and there may be other factors that influenced inflation rates in January 2018 that are not reflected in these tweets.</s>\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"0"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"docs = os.listdir('/kaggle/input/content/content/data-data')\n\nquestions_answers = {'Date': [], 'Question': [], 'Answer': []}\nfor document in docs:\n    questions_answers['Date'].append(document[:-4])\n\n    prompt = f\"based uniquely on the file {document},that contains tweets about inflation of the correspondent year_month that start by TWEET=, return the estimated inflation for the next month. keep in mind that inflation cannot be more than 10%.\"\n    print(prompt)\n    questions_answers['Question'].append(prompt)\n\n    question = prompt\n    responses = query_engine.query(question)\n    answer = responses.response\n    answer = answer.split(\"Assistant:\")[-1]\n    print(f\"Response:\\n{answer}\")\n    questions_answers['Answer'].append(answer)\n\n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n    gc.collect()\n","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":558},"id":"Lsjf9TSby-ue","outputId":"e44549ba-14e2-426b-ff51-973666277fb1","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-04T11:02:51.344771Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-04T11:02:51.345369Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"based uniquely on the file 2020_09.txt,that contains tweets about inflation of the correspondent year_month that start by TWEET=, return the estimated inflation for the next month. keep in mind that inflation cannot be more than 5%\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2f8304776c7a4ea2996953488ad39f72"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Executing...\nResponse:\n\nI have read the file 2020_09.txt and analyzed the content.
